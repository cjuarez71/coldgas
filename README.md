#The file 'measure_coldgas.py' contains all functions to make the measurements and their respective plots. The Voigt profile models for each target is in 'Voightmodels'. Absorption parameter initial guesses and results are in 'Voigtparams' with file names 'GOTOQJ--param.dat' and 'J--VP.dat', respectively. All spectra (including SDSS) are in 'fits'. 

#Data from Straka et al. 2015 and Rupke et al. 2005 are in 'strakarupke_data'. It contains SFR, stellar masses, and WNaI. 

#'IPdetections.txt' is the projected separations for visually confirmed absorption lines. 

#'emissiondata.txt' is the gaussian absoprtion parameter initial guesses for emission lines.

#'gotoqinfo.txt' contains general info for the targets (coordinates, projected separations, QSO/gal redshifts, etc.)

#'zHa_zNa.txt' has absorption (based on NaI or CaII) and emission (Ha or OIII) redshifts for all targets. Targets with the same absorption and emission redshift have no absorption lines. 

#'zNEW.txt' has absorption (based on NaI or CaII) and emission (Ha or OIII) redshifts for targets with visually confirmed absorption lines.
